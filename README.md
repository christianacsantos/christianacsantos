### **Welcome to my GitHub Profile!** 

Hello! I'm a dedicated oceanographer with a passion for knowledge. I earned my undergraduate degree at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, where I explored various facets of oceanography, culminating in a project on sediment dynamics.

After that, I embarked on a journey into the business world, where I had the opportunity to immerse myself in various areas of environmental management. During this time, I actively participated in scientific projects within the company, enhancing my academic background with practical knowledge.

Seeking to enhance my expertise in environmental management, I pursued an MBA at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, gaining solid knowledge of legal requirements and sustainable practices applicable to the corporate world.

Following a fulfilling tenure in the corporate sector, I felt the call of academia and returned voluntarily to delve even deeper into the scientific universe. I recently completed my master’s degree, where I conducted research on Marine Heatwaves—climatic phenomena that directly affect marine ecosystems. To share my work, I created a GitHub repository with data, code, and insights related to this fascinating topic.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Fluminense Federal University, where I research extreme ocean events and climate variability.

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and learning opportunities. If you're interested in oceanography, environmental science, or just want to exchange ideas, feel free to get in touch!

In addition to oceanography, I also serve as a mother, where I am called to the greatest experience of self-discovery one can have 💞️. 


📖 I'm a constant learner in Python and human development.
